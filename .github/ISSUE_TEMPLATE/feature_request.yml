        ## Considerations

        Is your feature request related to new section on prompt? Then consider the following questions:

        * Will it clutter the prompt?
        * Is it worth to be aware of it?
        * Will it slow down the prompt?

        Read more information about these points, see our [contributing guidelines][contributing].
